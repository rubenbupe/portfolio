This is a personal portfolio website that showcases my work and projects. It is built using Astro, and inspired by websites like Linear, Resend, Clerk, and others.

The website contains a homepage, and a blog created using Markdown files.

Live website: [https://rubenbupe.com](https://rubenbupe.com)

## Installation and usage

1. Install dependencies. I recommend using the node version specified in the `.nvmrc` file:

```
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

3. (Optional) Add your resume to the `public` folder so that the button on the homepage can link to it. The resume should be named `resume.pdf`.

## Building the website

The build process generates a production-ready version of the website that can be served using a static file server.

1. Create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

2. Serve the production build:

```
npm run start
```
